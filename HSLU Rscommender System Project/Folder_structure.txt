Folder Structure:

- Report.pdf
- Data Preparation and Visualization.ipynb
- Modeling.py

-> In response to RAM limitations, we opted to divide the project code into two files: one for Data Preparation and Visualization, and the other for advanced models and evalation."

Thanks for your understanding!
